/**
 * Code points that carry no visible glyph of their own but change how the text around
 * them renders — or render as nothing at all. A display name is echoed into the
 * leaderboard, the tank list, the public evidence log and the TXT export, so any of
 * these lets one player reorder or impersonate another player's row.
 *
 * Ranges, and why each is here:
 *   0000-001F, 007F-009F  C0 controls, DEL, C1 controls
 *   00AD                  SOFT HYPHEN (invisible Cf)
 *   034F                  COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER (invisible)
 *   061C                  ARABIC LETTER MARK (bidi Cf)
 *   115F, 1160            HANGUL CHOSEONG/JUNGSEONG FILLER (blank glyphs)
 *   180B-180F             Mongolian free variation selectors + MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR
 *   200B-200F             ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ, LRM, RLM
 *   2028, 2029            LINE / PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (would break the TXT export)
 *   202A-202E             LRE, RLE, PDF, LRO, RLO — the bidi override spoofing vector
 *   2060-206F             WORD JOINER, invisible operators, 2066-2069 isolates,
 *                         206A-206F deprecated format controls
 *   3164, FFA0            HANGUL FILLER, HALFWIDTH HANGUL FILLER (blank glyphs)
 *   FEFF                  ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE / BOM
 *   FFF9-FFFB             interlinear annotation controls
 *   1D173-1D17A           musical notation format controls
 *   E0000-E0FFF           tag characters (can smuggle hidden ASCII) + variation
 *                         selectors supplement
 *
 * Deliberately NOT stripped: FE00-FE0F (variation selectors, including VS16, which
 * gives emoji their colour presentation) and ordinary combining marks — real names
 * need both. Note that 200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER *is* stripped: collapsing visually
 * identical duplicates is the point of this policy, and the cost is that a
 * multi-person ZWJ emoji sequence renders as its component emoji rather than one glyph.
