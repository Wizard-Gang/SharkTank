 * style-src can stay on 'self'. Game components avoid DOM style attributes; dynamic canvas
 * drawing is unaffected by CSP style policy. blob:/data: on img-src remain for canvas readback
 * and inlined sprites. connect-src covers the same-origin tank WebSocket; wss: is explicit for

 * analytics tags it injects downstream of this Worker. Without one it injects an unnonced
 * inline bootstrap and an external beacon, and a strict policy blocks both.
 *
 * This is why no external host is named here: the nonce authorises the edge's own injection
 * without widening the policy for anyone else.
